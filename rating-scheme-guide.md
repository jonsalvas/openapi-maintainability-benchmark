Dear participants,

thank you for taking part in this study.
You will find [8 OpenAPI 3.0 files] (https://github.com/xJREB/openapi-maintainability-benchmark/tree/master/openapi-files) in this repository as well as an excel rating sheet.
Please look through all of the OpenAPI files first and take some notes regarding maintainability, especially Complexity, Size and Cohesion.
Afterwards, please fill out the excel rating sheet.
Mark each properties for all OpenAPI files with marks from 1 to 10 (1 worst, 10 best). Please rate the documents relatively to each other while the best document in a specific property gets a 10 rating.
So, e.g. the document with the best size regarding maintainability gets a "10" and the other documents are then rated relatively to that document (even though you would rate them better or worse in
an absolute context from your experiences).
